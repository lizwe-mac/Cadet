# Donut Chart
The donut chart is a component that helps us display data in proportioned segments. Each segment is representative of a percentage value that makes up the whole 100%. The total 100% value is represented by the 360 degrees of the circle, with each segment taking up a percentage of that total amount.

### How to use the Donut Chart
The donut chart is exported as `<Donut>` in the components section of the project. To use the chart you will need to place the chart tags where you want it to be displayed. The `<Donut>` component must have a **label** property provided.

```tsx
<div>
    <Donut label="Fruits I consumed this week">
        ...
    </Donut>
</div>
```

Next, we need to define the segments of our chart. Each segment is defined by a `<DonutSlice>` tag that can be placed in the `<Donut>` tags. Each `<DonutSlice>` must have a **value**, **label**, and **colour** property. The **value** property of the slice contributes to the whole value of the chart and does not need to be a percentage. If you have 3 slices, each with the value of **40**, the chart will use **120** as the its benchmark for 100% and will see each value of **40** as a percentage of that.

```tsx
<div>
    <Donut label="Fruits I consumed this week">
        <DonutSlice label="Apples" value={50} colour="primary" />
        <DonutSlice label="Pears" value={12} colour="secondary" />
        <DonutSlice label="Oranges" value={33} colour="accent-2" />
    </Donut>
</div>
```
